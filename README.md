# PySchool District Analysis

## Overview of Project:

School District Analysis on grade performance using Jupyter Notebook with Python, Pandas Library, and Numpy library.

Maria is responsible for preparing data for insights into performance trends. We are working with Maria(our client) to ensure these results are correctly analyzed on student funding and test scores.

The school board will like to analyze test scores to help the school make better decisions. 

We will now review the data below and see the results.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?


How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:


Math and reading scores by grade


Scores by school spending


Scores by school size


Scores by school type

## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

* District Analysis - changes to all scores by less than 0.5 percentage points (or change by less than 0.5%) - no impact to school or student count.
* Top School Ranking - no change to ranking, however Thomas High School scores did change, but by less than 1 percentage point (or changed by less than * 1%) for each metric.
* Scores by School Size - changes to Medium (1000-2000) grouping for all scores by less than 0.1 percentage points (or change by less than 0.1%).
* Scores by School Type - changes to Charter type grouping for all scores by less than 0.1 percentage points (or change by less than 0.1%).
